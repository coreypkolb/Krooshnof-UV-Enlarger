# Krooshnof-UV-Enlarger
Open source UV enlarger for alternative photographic processes
## Warning
UV light is dangerous and could lead to permanent eye damage. Wear appropriate eye protection when using this enlarger. Parts of this process will involve potential risk of electrick shock. Exercise caution and know your limits.
## Introduction
The Krooshnof UV Enlarger is an open source enlarger design that will enable you to enlarge black and white negatives into cyanotype prints, platinum palladium prints, and other alternative photographic printing processes. This repository and accomanying resources serve as a starting point for you to modify and build your own enlarger based on Douwe Krooshnof's original design.
### Who is this for?
If you are an analouge photographer who is interested in alternative photographic processes and would rather not make a digital print but rather utilize the negatives you shoot, then this project is for you. You must be comfortable with DIY. Maybe you know your way around a soldering iron or you are willing to learn.
### How much will it cost?
This depends on a number of factors like what tools or materials you have already. The price can be as low as $300 USD.
## Basic design and components

The Krooshnof UV Enlarger is a point source enlarger. UV light, ideally 385nm, starts at the UV LED. The light travels through a collimating fresnel lens, a condensing fresnel lens, the negative, and finally the printing surface.
